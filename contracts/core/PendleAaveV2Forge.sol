/**
* @dev READ ME: In AaveV2, there are 2 types of balances: scaled balance & displayed balance
    scaled balance (SBAL) is the balance received when scaledBalanceOf() is called. It is the
        balance value that is actually stored in the contract
    displayed balance (DBAL) is the balance received when balanceOf() is called. It is calculated
        by SBAL * incomeIndex
    Due to fixed point precision error, two different DBAL can have the exact same SBAL.
        For example: 2 DBALs of 10^10 and 10^10-3, at the moment where the incomeIndex =
        5877566951907055216799556412, has the exact same SBAL. => In the future, the two DBAL will
        be equal again if the incomeIndex is appropriate
    This led to the issue where user A transfer 10^10 to user B, then user A's DBAL decreased by
        10^10, but user B's DBAL increased by only 10^10-3. Note that AaveV2's transfer actually
        transfer by SBAL and not DBAL. As a result, the amount of SBAL user B receives will be
        equal to the amount of SBAL that user A transfer.
    Ironically, even if the amounts of SBAL are equal, user B cannot immediately transfer back
        10^10 to user A since AaveV2 requires both the SBAL & DBAL to be >= the amount of SBAL
        & DBAL that B wants to transfer, and it's clear that user B, despite having enough SBAL
        , only have 10^10-3 in DBAL and therefore cannot transfer back
* @dev The smooth function used in this contract aims to resolve the above issue. It finds the
        smallest res that rayDiv(dividen,incomeIndex) = rayDiv(res,incomeIndex). So if multiple
        DBAL correspond to the same value of SBAL, the smallest DBAL will be returned.
    One very important thing to note is that the smooth function, for example smooth(X,Y)=Z,
        doesn't change the amount of SBAL since X/Y = Z/Y, so the amount of SBAL transfered is
        unchanged IF AND ONLY IF the transfer happens immediately (in the same transaction).
    So for the 10^10 transfer above, user B will only acknowledge that he has received
        smooth(10^10,incomeIndex) = 10^10-3, and when the time to pay back comes, user B will only
        pay smooth(10^10-3,incomeIndex2) back. In both transactions, the amount of SBAL that B & A
        will receive are not affected by smooth.
